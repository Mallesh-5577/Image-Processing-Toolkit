# 🖼️ Image Processing & Analysis Toolkit

A **Streamlit-powered web application** for experimenting with classical computer vision (CV) operations.  
Upload an image, select transformations/filters, and compare original vs processed results side-by-side.  
This project demonstrates how OpenCV, NumPy, and scikit-image can be combined with Streamlit to create an interactive image processing playground.

  - Translation (shift X/Y)  
  - Affine transform (3-point mapping)  
  - Perspective transform (4-point mapping)  

- **Filtering & Morphological Operations**
  - Gaussian, Median, and Mean filtering  
  - Edge operators: Sobel, Laplacian  
  - Morphology: Dilation, Erosion, Opening, Closing  

- **Image Enhancement**
